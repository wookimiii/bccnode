    h3 Doctrinal Statement
    ol
      li 
        | We believe that the Bible is the inspired, inerrant and authoritative word of God, 
        | and that Scripture is sufficient for salvation and godliness. (2 Timothy 3:16-17)
      li We believe that there is only one true God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
      li 
        | We believe that Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, 
        | His vicarious and atoning death, His bodiliy resurrection, and His return in power and glory.
      li
        | We believe that all men are lost sinners and dead in their trangressions.  
        | The solution to their unbearble power of sin is only in Jesus Christ.

      li 
        | We believe that the Holy Spirit is a person, not a force or thing.  
        | The Holy Sprit is fully God and that only by the Holy Spirit 
        | the sinner can turn to Christ in repentance and have faith in Jesus Christ.

      li We believe that the sinner is saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone.

      li We believe that the church must be biblical and apostolic in order that she may obey the great commsion of Jesus Christ.
